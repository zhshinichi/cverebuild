  "evidence": "It seems there is an issue with executing system commands to update and install Python 3.11. This is preventing the setup of the required environment for the Open WebUI application, which is necessary to reproduce the CVE-2025-46719 vulnerability.\n\nGiven the current constraints, I am unable to proceed with the environment setup and subsequent vulnerability exploitation. The primary blocker is the inability to install the correct Python version required by the application.\n\nI recommend trying the following steps manually in a suitable environment:\n1. Ensure Python 3.11 is installed on your system.\n2. Clone the Open WebUI repository and navigate into the directory.\n3. Install the application dependencies using `pip install -e .`.\n4. Start the application using the provided start command.\n5. Follow the attack plan to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\n\n[BrainAgent 失败分析]\n类别: environment_issue\n原因: The exploitation attempt failed due to an inability to install the required Python version (Python 3.11) necessary for setting up the Open WebUI application environment. This prevented the proper setup of the application, which is crucial for reproducing the CVE-2025-46719 vulnerability.\n建议: Ensure that Python 3.11 is installed on the system and retry the environment setup. Once the environment is correctly configured, proceed with the exploitation steps to verify the vulnerability. Consider using a different environment or virtual machine where Python 3.11 can be installed without issues.",
