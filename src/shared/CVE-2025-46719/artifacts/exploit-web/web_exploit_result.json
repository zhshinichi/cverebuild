This indicates that the server might not be running or accessible at the specified address and port.\n\n### Self-Reflection & Retry Strategy\n\n**Analysis of Failure:**\n- The server at `localhost:8080` is not responding, which could be due to it not being started, incorrect port configuration, or network issues.\n\n**Consider Alternatives:**\n- Verify that the Open WebUI platform is running on the correct port (`8080`).\n- Check if there are any firewall or network settings blocking access to the server.\n- Ensure that the server is configured to accept connections on `localhost`.\n\n**Retry Strategy:**\n1. Confirm that the Open WebUI server is running and accessible on `localhost:8080`.\n2. If the server is running on a different port, update the URL accordingly.\n3. Retry navigating to the URL once the server is confirmed to be running.\n\nPlease ensure the server is running and accessible, then let me know if you want to retry or if there are any changes to the server configuration.",
