"# CVE Report for CVE-2025-7122\n\n## Detailed Summary\nCVE-2025-7122 is a critical vulnerability found in the Campcodes Complaint Management System version 1.0. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-89 (SQL Injection) and CWE-74 (Injection). It affects the `/admin/index.php` file, where the manipulation of the `Username` argument can lead to SQL injection attacks. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.\n\n## Root Cause of the Vulnerability\nThe root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user input in the `/admin/index.php` file. Specifically, the application does not adequately sanitize or validate the `Username` parameter before using it in SQL queries. This oversight allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `Username` input, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or even complete control over the database.\n\nTo understand the root cause in terms of code, we can analyze the patch (if provided) and the security advisory. The patch would typically involve the implementation of prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure that user input is treated as data rather than executable code. However, since the patch details are not provided in this case, we can infer that the original code likely concatenated the `Username` directly into the SQL query string, making it vulnerable to injection.\n\n## Exploitation Details\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would craft a specially formatted request to the `/admin/index.php` endpoint, manipulating the `Username` parameter to include SQL injection payloads. For example, an attacker might use a payload like:\n\n```\n' OR '1'='1'; --\n```\n\nThis payload could allow the attacker to bypass authentication checks or extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Environment Setup Requirements\n- Port: Not explicitly mentioned in the advisory, but typically web applications run on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).\n- Target Endpoint: `/admin/index.php`\n- Explicit Configuration: None mentioned in the advisory.\n\n## Complete PoC Code\nThe advisory does not provide any specific proof-of-concept code. However, a typical PoC for this vulnerability might look like the following:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"http://<target-ip>/admin/index.php?Username=' OR '1'='1'; --\"\n```\n\nThis command sends a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, attempting to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability by manipulating the `Username` parameter. \n\nIn conclusion, CVE-2025-7122 represents a significant security risk due to its potential for SQL injection, and it is crucial for users of the affected version to apply the necessary patches and implement secure coding practices to mitigate such vulnerabilities."
