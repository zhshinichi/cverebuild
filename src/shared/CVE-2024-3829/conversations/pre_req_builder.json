    "overview": "CVE-2024-3829 affects the `qdrant` software, specifically version 1.8.4, due to improper input validation during the snapshot recovery process. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit symlinks in snapshot files to read sensitive files and write arbitrary files, potentially leading to system takeover. The issue is fixed in version 1.9.0. The project structure includes directories for configuration, documentation, libraries, and tests, with the core functionality likely residing in the `lib` and `src` directories.",
    "files": "- `README.md`: Important for understanding project setup and dependencies.\n- `requirements.txt`: If present, will list Python dependencies needed for the project.\n- `poc_read.py` and `poc_write.py`: Proof of concept scripts demonstrating the exploitation of the vulnerability.",
    "services": "- **HTTP Server**: The project runs on port 6333. Ensure that the server is accessible at `http://localhost:6333`.\n- **Configuration**: No specific configuration files were identified, but ensure the server is running to handle requests for collections and snapshots.",
    "output": "The final output of the project will be the ability to create collections, manage snapshots, and demonstrate the exploitation of the vulnerability through the provided proof of concept scripts. Interaction can be done via HTTP requests to the specified endpoints for uploading and retrieving snapshots."
