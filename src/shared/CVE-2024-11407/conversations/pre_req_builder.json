    "overview": "gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework that allows client and server applications to communicate transparently. The CVE-2024-11407 vulnerability affects gRPC-C++ version v1.66.1, specifically when the zero copy feature is enabled, leading to potential data corruption and denial of service. The vulnerability is rooted in the handling of `iov_base` pointers in the `TcpZerocopySendRecord::PopulateIovs` function, which can cause incorrect data transmission over the network.",
    "files": "- README.md: Provides essential information about the project and setup instructions.\n- src/cpp/server/secure_server_credentials.cc: Contains the implementation of secure server credentials, relevant for setting up a secure gRPC server.\n- src/cpp/server/server_builder.cc: Implements the server builder, crucial for configuring and starting the gRPC server.\n- src/cpp/client/create_channel.cc: Implements channel creation, necessary for establishing client-server communication.",
    "services": "- gRPC server must be configured to listen on port 50051.\n- The `GRPC_ARG_TCP_TX_ZEROCOPY_ENABLED` argument must be set to `true` to reproduce the vulnerability.",
    "output": "The final output of the project will be a running gRPC server that can accept RPC requests on the specified endpoint, allowing for testing of the vulnerability by sending crafted requests that exploit the zero copy feature."
