    "overview": "CVE-2024-35235 affects OpenPrinting CUPS versions 2.4.8 and earlier, specifically related to improper handling of symbolic links in the \"Listen\" configuration. This vulnerability allows an attacker to change file permissions to world-writable by exploiting the cupsd server's handling of symbolic links, which can lead to further exploitation due to the server running with root privileges.",
    "files": "- conf/cupsd.conf: This is the main configuration file for CUPS where the \"Listen\" directive will be modified to exploit the vulnerability.\n- tools/exploit.sh: A proof-of-concept script that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by staging the environment, modifying the configuration, and restarting the cupsd service.",
    "services": "- CUPS service: The cupsd service must be running. It typically listens on port 631 for IPP. Ensure that the service is configured to allow modifications to the cupsd.conf file as described in the PoC.",
    "output": "The final output of the project, when set up successfully, will be the ability to demonstrate the vulnerability by changing the permissions of the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file to world-writable. This can be verified by checking the file permissions after restarting the cupsd service."
