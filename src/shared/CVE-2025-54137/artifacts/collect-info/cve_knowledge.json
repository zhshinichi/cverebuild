"# CVE Report for CVE-2025-54137\n\n## Detailed Summary\nCVE-2025-54137 is a security vulnerability found in HAX CMS NodeJS, specifically in versions 11.0.9 and below. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-1392, which pertains to the use of default credentials. The application is distributed with hardcoded default credentials for both user and superuser accounts, as well as default private keys for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). During installation, users are not prompted to change these credentials or secrets, and there is no user interface option to modify them post-installation. This oversight allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit the default credentials and JWT private keys, which are publicly accessible in the haxtheweb GitHub repositories. By leveraging these credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to self-hosted instances of the application, modify sites, and potentially execute further attacks. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 11.0.10 of the software.\n\n## Root Cause of the Vulnerability\nThe root cause of CVE-2025-54137 lies in the hardcoding of default credentials and JWT private keys within the application code. This practice is a significant security flaw, as it does not require users to set their own secure credentials during the installation process. The lack of prompts or mechanisms to change these defaults means that any instance of the application that is deployed without modification is vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nAnalyzing the patch (commit hash: 6dc2441c876350ca6fe9fbaecb058d92ef442869) reveals that the developers have likely removed the hardcoded credentials and introduced a mechanism that prompts users to set their own credentials during installation. This change is crucial in mitigating the risk associated with default credentials, as it forces users to create unique and secure access credentials.\n\n## Exploitation Details\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:\n1. Identify a self-hosted instance of HAX CMS NodeJS that is running version 11.0.9 or below.\n2. Access the public GitHub repositories of haxtheweb to retrieve the hardcoded default credentials and JWT private keys.\n3. Use the retrieved credentials to authenticate against the vulnerable instance, gaining unauthorized access to the application.\n4. Once authenticated, the attacker can modify sites and potentially escalate their attack further.\n\nThe advisory does not provide explicit steps for exploitation, but the outlined process above summarizes how an attacker could leverage the vulnerability.\n\n## Environment Setup Requirements\n- Port: 8080 (assumed default for NodeJS applications, as no specific port was mentioned)\n- Target Endpoint: `/api/login` (assumed endpoint for authentication, as no specific endpoint was mentioned)\n- Explicit Configuration: None mentioned in the advisory\n\n## Complete PoC Code\nThe advisory does not provide any specific proof-of-concept code. However, the exploitation would typically involve using the default credentials retrieved from the public repository to authenticate against the application. \n\nIn summary, CVE-2025-54137 represents a significant security risk due to the use of hardcoded default credentials and JWT private keys, which can be easily exploited by attackers if not addressed. The patch in version 11.0.10 is essential for securing instances of HAX CMS NodeJS against unauthorized access.\n\n## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (USE THIS - DO NOT GUESS!)\n\n**Repository URL**: https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues\n**Platform**: N/A\n**Language**: javascript\n**Build Tool**: npm\n\n### Build Commands:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues\ncd $(basename https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues)\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Start Commands:\n```bash\nnpm start  # 或 node server.js / node index.js\n```\n\n### Deployment Notes:\n从 GitHub 源码部署。语言: javascript, 构建工具: npm\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:\n1.
