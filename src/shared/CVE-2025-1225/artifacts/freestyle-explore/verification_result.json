This prevented the setup of the necessary environment to reproduce the vulnerability.\n建议: To proceed with the exploitation attempt, acquire the specific version of the ywoa software that is vulnerable to CVE-2025-1225. This may involve reaching out to the vendor or searching for alternative sources where the software version might be available. Once the environment is set up, reattempt the exploitation steps.",
