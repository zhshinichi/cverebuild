This suggests that the endpoint used for testing was incorrect or not configured to accept XML data, which is necessary to trigger the XXE vulnerability.\n建议: Verify the correct endpoint for XML processing and ensure the application is configured to accept XML data. Re-attempt the exploitation with the correct setup to determine if the vulnerability is present.",
