    "analysis": "The deployment process began with an attempt to locate the project directory for Symfony. However, the directory was not found, indicating that the source code had not yet been downloaded. As a result, the deployment process proceeded to clone the repository from GitHub.

    "feedback": "Ensure that the repository is cloned successfully by running: `git clone https://github.com/symfony/symfony`. After cloning, navigate to the project directory and run `composer install` to install dependencies. Finally, start the service using the command: `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public`."
