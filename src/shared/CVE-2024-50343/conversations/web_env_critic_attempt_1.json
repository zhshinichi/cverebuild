    "analysis": "The deployment process encountered an issue where the specified port (8080) was not used in the startup command. Instead, the startup command used port 8000, which is a common port for PHP's built-in server. This discrepancy indicates that while the service may have started, it was not on the expected port, which could lead to accessibility issues if the service was expected to be reachable on port 8080.",
    "decision": "no",
    "possible": "yes",
    "feedback": "Ensure to update the startup command to use the specified port 8080. Modify the command to: `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public` to align with the inferred environment configuration."
