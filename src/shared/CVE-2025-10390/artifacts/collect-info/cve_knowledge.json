"# CVE Report for CVE-2025-10390\n\n## Detailed Summary\nCVE-2025-10390 is a vulnerability identified in the CRMEB software, specifically affecting versions up to 5.6.1. The vulnerability is located in the `editAddress` function within the file `app/services/user/UserAddressServices.php`. This weakness allows for improper authorization due to manipulation of the argument ID, which can lead to unauthorized access to user address information. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, making it a significant security concern. The affected version of the software is 5.6.0.\n\n## Root Cause of the Vulnerability\nThe root cause of CVE-2025-10390 lies in the lack of proper authorization checks within the `editAddress` function. When the function processes the ID argument, it does not adequately verify whether the user has the necessary permissions to edit the address associated with that ID. This oversight allows an attacker to manipulate the ID parameter in a request, potentially gaining access to modify addresses that do not belong to them.\n\nAnalyzing the patch (which is not provided here), one would typically expect to see added checks to ensure that the user making the request is authorized to edit the address corresponding to the provided ID. This could involve verifying the user's identity against the address owner or implementing role-based access controls.\n\n## Exploit Details\nWhile the security advisory does not provide explicit steps to exploit the vulnerability, we can infer a general approach based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n1. An attacker would send a request to the `editAddress` function with a manipulated ID parameter.\n2. The attacker would need to identify valid ID values that correspond to addresses belonging to other users.\n3. By crafting a request that includes the manipulated ID, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to modify the address data.\n\nThe exploit could look something like this:\n\n```http\nPOST /api/user/editAddress HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable-crmeb-instance.com\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n    \"id\": \"malicious_id_value\",\n    \"new_address\": \"123 Fake Street\"\n}\n```\n\n## Environment Setup Requirements\n- Port: 80 (default for HTTP, assuming no specific port is mentioned)\n- Target Endpoint: `/api/user/editAddress`\n- Explicit Configuration: None mentioned in the advisory\n\n## Complete PoC Code\nThe advisory does not provide any proof-of-concept code. However, based on the nature of the vulnerability, the PoC would likely involve sending a crafted HTTP request as shown in the exploit details section. \n\nIn conclusion, CVE-2025-10390 represents a critical vulnerability due to improper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate user address data. It is essential for users of affected versions to apply patches and implement proper access controls to mitigate this risk.\n\n## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (USE THIS - DO NOT GUESS!)\n\n**Repository URL**: https://github.com/crmeb/CRMEB\n**Platform**: N/A\n**Language**: php\n**Build Tool**: composer\n\n### Build Commands:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/crmeb/CRMEB\ncd $(basename https://github.com/crmeb/CRMEB)/crmeb\ncomposer install\n```\n\n### Start Commands:\n```bash\n# 推荐: cd $(basename https://github.com/crmeb/CRMEB)/docker-compose && docker-compose up -d\n# 或手动: php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public\n```\n\n### Deployment Notes:\n⚠️ 推荐使用官方 docker-compose 部署（路径: docker-compose） | 需要 PHP 7.4（不兼容 PHP 8+） | 工作目录: crmeb/（composer.json 在子目录） | 必需扩展: curl, bcmath, simplexml, gd, dom | 默认端口: 80\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:\n1.
