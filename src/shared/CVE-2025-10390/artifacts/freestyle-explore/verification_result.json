This prevented the application from running, thus blocking the execution of the proof of concept (PoC) for the vulnerability.\n建议: Adjust the environment to use a compatible PHP version (7.1 to 7.4) and then reattempt the exploitation. Ensure that all dependencies and configurations are correctly set up to allow the CRMEB application to run properly.",
