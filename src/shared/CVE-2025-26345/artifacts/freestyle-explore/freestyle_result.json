  "output": "The simulated HTTP server responded with an error code `501 Not Implemented` when attempting to send a crafted POST request to the `/api/user/group/edit` endpoint. This indicates that the server does not support the POST method or the specific endpoint is not implemented in the simulation.\n\n### Current Status:\n- The environment setup was partially successful with a simulated HTTP server.\n- The crafted HTTP request could not be processed due to the lack of a proper implementation of the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo accurately reproduce the vulnerability, I need access to the actual Q-Free MaxTime application or a more detailed simulation of its API endpoints. The current simulation does not replicate the required functionality to test the authentication bypass vulnerability.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"verification_result\": {\n    \"env_ready\": true,\n    \"poc_executed\": true,\n    \"passed\": false,\n    \"evidence\": \"The server responded with '501 Not Implemented' for the crafted POST request, indicating the endpoint is not implemented in the simulation.\",\n    \"error_message\": \"The simulated environment does not accurately replicate the vulnerable endpoint.\"\n  }\n}\n```",
