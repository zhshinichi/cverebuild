The server responded with '501 Not Implemented', indicating that the specific endpoint or method required for the exploit was not implemented in the simulation.\n建议: Set up a more accurate simulation of the Q-Free MaxTime application, ensuring that the vulnerable endpoint is implemented and accessible. Alternatively, test against an actual instance of the application to verify the presence of the vulnerability.",
