"# CVE Report for CVE-2025-26345\n\n## Detailed Summary\nCVE-2025-26345 is a vulnerability classified under CWE-306, which refers to \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\" This vulnerability exists in the Q-Free MaxTime software, specifically in the `maxprofile/menu/routes.lua` file. The affected version of the software is 2.11.0 or earlier. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to manipulate user group permissions by sending specially crafted HTTP requests, potentially leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.\n\n## Root Cause of the Vulnerability\nThe root cause of this vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authentication checks for critical functions within the application. In the `routes.lua` file, there are likely endpoints that handle user group permissions without verifying whether the requester is authenticated. This oversight allows any user, regardless of their authentication status, to send requests to modify user permissions.\n\nTo analyze the root cause further, we can look at the patch (though not provided here) and the advisory details. The patch would typically include added authentication checks or middleware that ensures only authenticated users can access the endpoints responsible for modifying user group permissions. The absence of such checks in the original code is what makes this vulnerability exploitable.\n\n## Exploitation Details\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints that handle user group permissions. The attacker could use tools like `curl` or Postman to send these requests without any authentication tokens or credentials. The requests would likely include parameters that specify the user group and the permissions to be modified.\n\n### Example Exploit Overview\n1. The attacker identifies the endpoint responsible for editing user group permissions.\n2. The attacker crafts an HTTP request that includes the necessary parameters to change permissions.\n3. The attacker sends the request to the server, which processes it without any authentication checks, allowing the modification to occur.\n\n## Environment Setup Requirements\n- Port: 80 (assuming default HTTP port, as no specific port is mentioned)\n- Target Endpoint: `/api/user/group/edit` (example endpoint for editing user group permissions, as no specific endpoint is provided)\n- Explicit Configuration: None mentioned in the advisory\n\n## Complete PoC Code\nUnfortunately, the advisory does not provide any proof-of-concept code. However, a typical PoC for this vulnerability might look like the following:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://<target-ip>/api/user/group/edit \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-d '{\"group_id\": \"1\", \"permissions\": [\"edit\", \"delete\"]}'\n```\n\nThis command sends a POST request to the hypothetical endpoint to edit the permissions of a user group without any authentication, demonstrating the vulnerability. \n\n**Note:** The actual endpoint and parameters may vary based on the implementation in the `routes.lua` file."
