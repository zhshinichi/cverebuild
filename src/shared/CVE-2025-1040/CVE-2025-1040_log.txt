# CVE-2025-1040 Detailed Report

## Summary
CVE-2025-1040 is a vulnerability found in AutoGPT versions 0.3.4 and earlier, classified under CWE-77, which pertains to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, leading to command injection. The vulnerability arises from the `AgentOutputBlock` implementation, where user-supplied format strings are passed to the Jinja2 templating engine without adequate security measures. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The issue has been addressed in version 0.4.0 of the software.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way the `AgentOutputBlock` class handles user input. Specifically, it accepts a format string from the user and directly passes it to the Jinja2 templating engine without filtering or sanitizing the input. The relevant code snippet shows that the Jinja2 environment is initialized without a sandbox, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code:

```python
jinja = Environment(loader=BaseLoader())
```

This lack of a sandbox environment means that any malicious input can be executed, leading to potential command injection. The patch introduced a `TextFormatter` class that utilizes a `SandboxedEnvironment`, which restricts the execution capabilities of the templates, thereby mitigating the risk of arbitrary command execution.

## Exploitation Details
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can create a Fill Text Template block within the AutoGPT application. The attacker would then save the agent with a malicious SSTI payload designed to execute arbitrary commands. The payload example provided in the advisory is:

```plaintext
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}
```

Once the agent is saved, the attacker can trigger the execution by clicking the run button, which would render the malicious template and execute the `id` command on the host system.

## Environment Setup Requirements
- **Port**: 5000 (assumed default for local development)
- **Target Endpoint**: `/api/agent/run` (assumed endpoint for running agents)
- **Explicit Configuration**: None explicitly mentioned in the advisory.

## Complete PoC Code
The advisory does not provide a complete proof-of-concept code snippet, but it does describe the payload that can be used to exploit the vulnerability. The relevant parts of the code that demonstrate the vulnerability are as follows:

```python
def run(self, input_data: Input, **kwargs) -> BlockOutput:
    ...
    if input_data.format:
        try:
            fmt = re.sub(r"(?<!{){[ a-zA-Z0-9_]+}", r"{\g<0>}", input_data.format)
            template = jinja.from_string(fmt)
            yield "output", template.render({input_data.name: input_data.value})
            ...
```

The patch that addresses the vulnerability is as follows:

```python
# In basic.py
formatter = TextFormatter()

def run(self, input_data: Input, **kwargs) -> BlockOutput:
    ...
    if input_data.format:
        try:
            yield "output", formatter.format_string(
                input_data.format, {input_data.name: input_data.value}
            )
        except Exception as e:
            yield "output", f"Error: {e}, {input_data.value}"
```

This change introduces a `TextFormatter` that uses a `SandboxedEnvironment` to mitigate the risk of command injection.

## Conclusion
CVE-2025-1040 represents a significant security risk due to its potential for Remote Code Execution through improper handling of user input in the AutoGPT application. The vulnerability has been effectively mitigated in version 0.4.0 by implementing a sandboxed environment for template rendering, which restricts the execution capabilities of user-supplied templates. Users of affected versions are strongly advised to upgrade to the latest version to protect against this vulnerability.

👀 Running Critic on Repo Builder ...
-------------------------------------------

🪖 Critic Response: '''
<report>
<analysis>
1. Actions performed: The repo builder executed only two exploratory commands – `ls` to list the contents of autogpt/agent and `get_file` to view the first 20 lines of requirements.txt.  
2. No build / install commands (`pip install -r requirements.txt`, `pip install autogpt==0.3.4`, etc.) were executed. No server was started, and no verification of a running service on port 5000 was done.  
3. Therefore the project is not actually set up; it is still in the “just looked at files” stage.  
4. No indication of the agent having injected any new code or dummy vulnerability – they simply did nothing beyond reading.  
5. Project type (Python) was detected correctly; no wrong-tool mismatch.  
6. No “giving up” behaviour yet, but agent stopped before doing any meaningful setup.  
7. Result: environment is NOT ready for exploitation; the vulnerable version is neither installed nor running.
</analysis>
<decision>no</decision>
<possible>yes</possible>
<feedback>
The agent only listed a directory and opened requirements.txt; it never installed dependencies, never ensured the vulnerable version (≤ 0.3.4) is in use, and never started the Flask server on port 5000. Nothing is built or running.

Summary of work already done:
• Ran `ls autogpt/agent`, confirming code is present.  
• Viewed first 20 lines of requirements.txt to see dependency list.  
(No further actions.)

What went wrong:
• Did not run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or otherwise install the vulnerable AutoGPT code.  
• Did not verify that the code is the vulnerable 0.3.4 (or earlier) version; patch file basic.py may have fixed the bug.  
• Did not start the web service on port 5000 or confirm `/api/agent/run` is accessible.

=== HIGH PRIORITY PLAN (MUST EXECUTE IN ORDER) ===
Step 1: cd /workspace (or the project root containing requirements.txt)
Step 2: python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
Step 4: git fetch --tags && git checkout v0.3.4   # ensure we are on the vulnerable tag
Step 5: pip install -e .   # install the local vulnerable package in editable mode
Step 6: export FLASK_APP=autogpt/app.py            # adjust path if app.py lives elsewhere
Step 7: flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000 &
Step 8: sleep 5 && curl -I http://localhost:5000/api/agent/run  # sanity-check the API is reachable
=== END HIGH PRIORITY PLAN ===

After those steps the vulnerable AutoGPT 0.3.4 instance will be running and ready for exploitation tests.

Invoking: `execute_linux_command` with `{'command': 'pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt', 'background': False}`
responded: The previous attempts to set up the environment encountered issues:

1. **Git Checkout Failure**: The attempt to fetch and checkout the specific vulnerable version `v0.3.4` failed due to permission issues with the Git repository. This indicates that the repository might not be accessible or the environment lacks the necessary SSH keys or access rights.

2. **Dependency Installation Timeout**: The installation of dependencies from `requirements.txt` failed due to a timeout error while downloading packages. This could be due to network issues or a temporary unavailability of the package repository.

To proceed, I will attempt the following:

- Retry the installation of dependencies with a focus on ensuring network stability.
- Attempt to manually verify the version of the codebase to ensure it is vulnerable.
- Start the Flask server to verify if the application is running and accessible.

Let's start by retrying the installation of dependencies and checking the current version of the codebase.

📋 反思结果:
   分析: 在失败记录中，第一条命令因权限不足而失败，提示“Permission denied”。第二条命令因超时而失败，可能是网络问题或虚拟环境配置不当。第三条命令则因断言错误而失败，可能与第二条命令的执行结果有关，表明虚拟环境未能正确激活或配置。
   建议: 1. 确保当前用户具有足够的权限来执行 git 命令。可以使用以下命令检查当前用户：
   ```bash
   whoami
   ```
   如果需要，可以使用 `sudo` 提升权限（如果适用）。

2. 使用 git clone 而不是 git fetch 和 checkout，避免权限问题：
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   cd repo
   git checkout v0.3.4  # 切换到指定版本
   ```

3. 确保网络连接正常，避免 pip 安装时超时。可以尝试增加 pip 的超时时间：
   ```bash
   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt --timeout=100
   ```

4. 如果虚拟环境未能正确激活，确保使用以下命令激活：
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. 如果仍然遇到问题，建议重新创建虚拟环境：
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   ```

⚠️ **中途反思警告**

我检测到你正在重复执行失败的操作。请立即停止当前策略并阅读以下分析：

### 问题分析
在失败记录中，第一条命令因权限不足而失败，提示“Permission denied”。第二条命令因超时而失败，可能是网络问题或虚拟环境配置不当。第三条命令则因断言错误而失败，可能与第二条命令的执行结果有关，表明虚拟环境未能正确激活或配置。

### 修正建议
1. 确保当前用户具有足够的权限来执行 git 命令。可以使用以下命令检查当前用户：
   ```bash
   whoami
   ```
   如果需要，可以使用 `sudo` 提升权限（如果适用）。

2. 使用 git clone 而不是 git fetch 和 checkout，避免权限问题：
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   cd repo
   git checkout v0.3.4  # 切换到指定版本
   ```

3. 确保网络连接正常，避免 pip 安装时超时。可以尝试增加 pip 的超时时间：
   ```bash
   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt --timeout=100
   ```

4. 如果虚拟环境未能正确激活，确保使用以下命令激活：
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. 如果仍然遇到问题，建议重新创建虚拟环境：
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   ```

请根据以上建议调整你的执行策略，不要继续重复相同的失败操作。

Invoking: `get_file` with `{'file_path': 'autogpt/agent/AgentOutputBlock.py', 'num_lines': 20, 'offset': 0}`
responded: The previous attempts to set up the environment encountered issues:

1. **Git Checkout Failure**: The attempt to fetch and checkout the specific vulnerable version `v0.3.4` failed due to permission issues with the Git repository. This indicates that the repository might not be accessible or the environment lacks the necessary SSH keys or access rights.

2. **Dependency Installation Timeout**: The installation of dependencies from `requirements.txt` failed due to a timeout error while downloading packages. This could be due to network issues or a temporary unavailability of the package repository.

To proceed, I will attempt the following:

- Retry the installation of dependencies with a focus on ensuring network stability.
- Attempt to manually verify the version of the codebase to ensure it is vulnerable.
- Start the Flask server to verify if the application is running and accessible.

Let's start by retrying the installation of dependencies and checking the current version of the codebase.

responded: The previous attempts to set up the environment encountered issues:

1. **Dependency Installation Failure**: The installation of dependencies from `requirements.txt` failed due to an assertion error, which might be related to the virtual environment setup or package conflicts.

2. **File Access Issue**: The attempt to access `autogpt/agent/AgentOutputBlock.py` failed because the file does not exist. This suggests that the directory structure might be different or incomplete.

To proceed, I will attempt the following:

- Verify the current directory structure to ensure the necessary files are present.
- Retry the installation of dependencies with increased timeout to handle network issues.
- Attempt to manually verify the version of the codebase to ensure it is vulnerable.

Let's start by verifying the directory structure and retrying the installation of dependencies.
