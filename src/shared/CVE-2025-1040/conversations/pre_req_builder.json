    "overview": "AutoGPT is a Python-based application that allows users to create and manage agents. The application has a vulnerability (CVE-2025-1040) in versions 0.3.4 and earlier, specifically in the `AgentOutputBlock` class, which improperly handles user-supplied format strings leading to command injection. The vulnerability is mitigated in version 0.4.0 by implementing a `TextFormatter` that uses a `SandboxedEnvironment` for template rendering.",
    "files": "- `autogpt/agent/AgentOutputBlock.py`: Contains the vulnerable implementation of the `AgentOutputBlock` class.\n- `autogpt/agent/basic.py`: Contains the patched implementation with the `TextFormatter` and `SandboxedEnvironment`.\n- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project, which are crucial for setting up the environment.",
    "services": "- **Web Server**: The application runs on port 5000, which is the default for local development. Ensure that this port is open and accessible.\n- **API Endpoint**: The target endpoint for running agents is `/api/agent/run`. This endpoint is critical for testing the vulnerability.",
    "output": "The final output of the project is a web application that allows users to create and run agents. Users can interact with the application through a web interface, specifically by creating Fill Text Template blocks and triggering the execution of agents, which can potentially exploit the vulnerability."
