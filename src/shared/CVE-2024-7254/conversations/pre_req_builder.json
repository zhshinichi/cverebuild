    "overview": "The project is a Java implementation of the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) library, specifically affected by CVE-2024-7254, which involves improper input validation leading to potential stack overflow due to unbounded recursion when parsing nested groups. The vulnerability is present in version 28.1 of the protobuf library. The project includes various components for different languages, but the Java part is critical for reproducing the CVE.",
    "files": "- `java/core/src/main/java/com/google/protobuf`: Contains the main Java implementation of the protobuf library.\n- `java/core/src/main/resources/google/protobuf`: Contains resource files necessary for protobuf operations.\n- `java/core/src/test/java/com/google/protobuf`: Contains test files that may help in understanding how to trigger the vulnerability.\n- `protos`: Contains protobuf definitions that can be used to craft malicious messages.\n- `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`: Dependency management files that will specify the protobuf version needed (28.x).",
    "services": "- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Required to run the Java application.\n- **Web Server**: A simple HTTP server should be set up to listen on port 8080 and handle requests to the `/parse` endpoint for parsing protobuf messages.\n- **Configuration**: Ensure the server is configured to use the vulnerable version of the protobuf library (28.1).",
    "output": "The final output of the project will be a running server that can accept POST requests at the `/parse` endpoint. The server will attempt to parse the incoming protobuf messages, and if crafted correctly, it will lead to a stack overflow, demonstrating the vulnerability."
