This indicates that the server is not running or is not accessible at the specified address and port.\n\n### Analysis and Next Steps\n\n1. **Verify Server Status**: Ensure that the server is running on `localhost` and listening on port `9600`. This can be done by checking the server logs or using network tools to verify the service status.\n\n2. **Check Network Configuration**: Ensure that there are no firewall rules or network configurations blocking access to the server on `localhost:9600`.\n\n3. **Retry Connection**: Once the server is confirmed to be running and accessible, attempt to navigate to the URL again.\n\n4. **Alternative Approach**: If the server cannot be accessed, consider setting up a local environment or using a different target that is known to be running and accessible.\n\nPlease ensure the server is up and running, and let me know if you would like to retry or need further assistance with a different approach.",
