    "overview": "CVE-2025-1752 is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the `KnowledgeBaseWebReader` class of the `llama-index-readers-web` package, specifically in version 0.3.5. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the `max_depth` parameter in the `get_article_urls` function, allowing for excessive resource consumption through uncontrolled recursion. The issue has been patched in version 0.3.6, which introduces a depth tracking mechanism to prevent stack overflow.",
    "files": "- `llama_index/readers/web/knowledge_base/README.md`: Provides installation instructions and usage details for the web crawler.\n- `llama_index/readers/web/knowledge_base/requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies, specifically requiring `playwright` for browser automation.\n- `llama_index/readers/web/knowledge_base/base.py`: Contains the implementation of the `KnowledgeBaseWebReader` class, including the vulnerable `get_article_urls` function.",
    "services": "- **Playwright**: Required for browser automation. Must run `playwright install` to install necessary browsers.\n- **Python Environment**: Ensure Python is installed with access to install packages via pip.",
    "output": "The final output of the project is a web crawler that can fetch and scrape articles from knowledge bases. It can be interacted with by initializing the `KnowledgeBaseWebReader` with appropriate parameters and calling the `load_data` method to start crawling and scraping."
