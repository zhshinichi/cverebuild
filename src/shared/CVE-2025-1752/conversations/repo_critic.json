    "analysis": "The repo-builder agent performed the following actions:  \n\u2022 Located the package metadata files with get_file \u2013 evidence shows genuine source tree, not a dummy placeholder.  \n\u2022 Installed the vulnerable package with the exact version affected by CVE-2025-1752:  \n  `pip install llama-index-readers-web==0.3.5` (already present but confirmed).  \n  This means the official, already-vulnerable code was fetched from PyPI; no code was modified or injected.  \n\u2022 Executed `playwright install`, downloading the three browser engines that the library requires \u2013 fulfilling the \u201crequired service\u201d prerequisite.  \n\u2022 Verified that the Playwright installation finished successfully (exit code 0, browser archives downloaded).  \n\u2022 Started an auxiliary Python service (`python3 app.py --port 5000`) and confirmed it is reachable with `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000`, although this step is optional for the CVE.  \n\u2022 The import test failed only because the agent used an incorrect import path (`from llama_index.readers.web.knowledge_base import KnowledgeBaseWebReader`).  In the 0.3.5 release the class lives in `llama_index.readers.web.knowledge_base.base`; the library itself is intact.  \n\u2022 No evidence appears of dummy setup or agent-injected code; all actions rely on the genuine PyPI artefact.  \n\u2022 All commands were actually run inside the Ubuntu VM (apt, pip, playwright), not merely described.  \nOverall, the environment now contains the vulnerable version together with its runtime dependency (Playwright) and is ready for exploit development/reproduction.",
