    "overview": "CVE-2025-0454 is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Requests utility of the `significant-gravitas/autogpt` application, specifically in version v0.3.1. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass SSRF checks by submitting crafted URLs, leading to unauthorized access to internal services. The root cause is a discrepancy in URL processing between the `urlparse` function and the `requests` library. The patch modifies URL validation logic to prevent such bypasses.",
    "files": "- `autogpt/setup.py`: Contains setup instructions and dependencies for the project.\n- `docs/setup.md`: Provides detailed setup instructions, including environment requirements.\n- `docs/usage.md`: Describes how to run the application and its command line arguments.",
    "services": "- **HTTP Server**: The application runs on port 80 (default HTTP port). Ensure that the server is accessible at `http://localhost`.",
    "output": "The final output of the project is an interactive AI application that can be accessed via a web interface or command line, allowing users to interact with the AI and execute commands. Successful setup will enable users to run the application and test the SSRF vulnerability by submitting crafted URLs."
