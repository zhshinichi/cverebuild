# CVE Report: CVE-2025-0454

## Summary
CVE-2025-0454 is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability identified in the Requests utility of the `significant-gravitas/autogpt` application, specifically in versions prior to v0.4.0. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-918, which pertains to SSRF attacks. The affected version of the software is v0.3.1. The vulnerability allows a malicious user to bypass SSRF checks by submitting specially crafted URLs, such as `http://localhost:\@google.com/../`, which can lead to unauthorized access to internal services.

## Root Cause of the Vulnerability
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way the application processes URLs using the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` library and the `requests` library. The `urlparse` function does not interpret the backslash (`\`) character in the same way as the `requests` library does. Specifically, the `requests` library treats the backslash as a forward slash, leading to a hostname confusion. 

In the provided code, the `validate_url` function is responsible for checking the validity of the URL and ensuring it does not point to private or untrusted IP addresses. However, due to the aforementioned confusion, a crafted URL can bypass these checks, allowing an attacker to perform SSRF attacks.

The patch that addresses this vulnerability modifies the URL validation logic to prevent such bypasses by ensuring that the parsing of URLs is consistent and secure.

## Exploitation Details
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a specially crafted URL to the application. The following steps outline the exploitation process:

1. The attacker submits a URL like `http://localhost:\@google.com/../` to the application.
2. The application processes the URL using the `urlparse` function, which does not recognize the backslash as a delimiter, leading to a confusion in hostname resolution.
3. The request is then sent using the `requests` library, which interprets the backslash as a valid character, allowing the request to be executed against an internal service that the attacker should not have access to.

This exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive internal resources, making it a significant security risk.

## Environment Setup Requirements
- **Port**: 80 (default HTTP port)
- **Target Endpoint**: `http://localhost:\@google.com/../`
- **Explicit Configuration**: None explicitly mentioned in the advisory.
