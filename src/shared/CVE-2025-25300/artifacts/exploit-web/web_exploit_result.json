The error indicates that the connection was refused, which typically means the server is not running or the port is incorrect.\n\n### Self-Reflection & Retry Strategy\n1. **Analyze the failure**: The connection to the server was refused, indicating the server might not be running or the port is incorrect.\n2. **Consider alternatives**: Verify the server is running and the port is correct. Check if there are any firewall or network issues preventing access.\n3. **Try a different method**: Ensure the server is up and running, and retry the connection.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Verify the server is running on the correct port.\n- Check for any network or firewall settings that might be blocking the connection.\n- Retry navigating to the URL once the server is confirmed to be running.\n\nPlease ensure the server is running and accessible, then let me know to retry the connection.",
