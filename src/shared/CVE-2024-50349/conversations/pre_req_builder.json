    "overview": "CVE-2024-50349 is a vulnerability in Git (v2.40.3) related to improper handling of user prompts for credentials, allowing attackers to exploit control sequences in URLs. The vulnerability can mislead users into providing credentials to malicious sites. The patch introduces a `sanitize_prompt` option to mitigate this risk.",
    "files": "- **README.md**: Contains essential setup instructions and project details.\n- **config**: Configuration files that may include settings relevant to the credential handling.\n- **credential.c**: The source file where the vulnerability exists and where the patch is applied.\n- **t/**: Contains test files that may help in verifying the vulnerability and the patch.",
    "services": "- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed and configured correctly. The default configuration should have `credential.sanitizePrompt` set to `true` to mitigate the vulnerability.\n- **Network Access**: Port 443 should be open for HTTPS operations, as the exploit involves cloning from a malicious URL.",
    "output": "The final output of the project will be the ability to clone repositories using Git. If the setup is successful, running `git clone <malicious_url>` will demonstrate the vulnerability by prompting for credentials with misleading output."
