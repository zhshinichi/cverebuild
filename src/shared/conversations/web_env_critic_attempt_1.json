    "analysis": "The deployment of the Knowage-Server version 8.1.36 encountered multiple issues. Initially, the source code was downloaded successfully, but the extraction process timed out due to the absence of the `-o` flag in the unzip command, which caused it to wait for user input. Following this, attempts to install dependencies failed because neither `setup.py` nor `pyproject.toml` was found in the extracted directory, indicating that the project is not structured as a typical Python package. The startup command was executed, but the service failed to start because the required JAR file was not found in the expected directory. Consequently, the service could not be verified as running on the specified port (8080), leading to connection refusals when attempting to access it.",
    "decision": "no",
    "possible": "yes",
    "feedback": "Use `unzip -o -q v8.1.36.zip -d /workspaces/submission/src/simulation_environments/Knowage-Server` to avoid interactive prompts during extraction. Ensure that the project structure includes a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for installation. Verify the existence of the required JAR file in the expected directory before starting the service. If the JAR file is missing, check the build process or the contents of the downloaded package."
