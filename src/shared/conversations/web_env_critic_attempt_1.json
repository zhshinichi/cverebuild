    "analysis": "The deployment process for the Knowage-Server version 8.1.36 encountered multiple issues. Initially, the source code was successfully downloaded, but the extraction of the zip file timed out, indicating a potential issue with the unzip command. Attempts to unzip the file using both the standard and quiet flags failed. After confirming the contents of the downloaded zip file, it was evident that the project structure was intact.\n\nThe next step involved installing dependencies using pip, but the installation failed due to the absence of a setup.py or pyproject.toml file, which are essential for pip to recognize the project as installable. This indicates that the project may not be structured as a typical Python package.\n\nSubsequent attempts to build the project using Maven also failed. The Maven commands were executed in the wrong directory, leading to errors indicating that the necessary POM files were not found. Even after switching to the correct directory, the build failed due to missing child modules specified in the POM file, which suggests that the project is incomplete or improperly configured.\n\nOverall, the deployment was unsuccessful due to a combination of missing files, incorrect directory navigation, and potential issues with the project structure.",
    "decision": "no",
    "possible": "yes",
    "feedback": "Ensure that the project is properly structured as a Maven project with all required child modules present. Verify the existence of the necessary POM files and their configurations. Additionally, check the unzip command to ensure it completes successfully without timing out. If the project is not intended to be installed via pip, follow the correct build instructions for Maven from the project's documentation."
