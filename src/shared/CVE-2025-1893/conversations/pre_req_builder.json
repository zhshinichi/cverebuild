    "overview": "CVE-2025-1893 affects Open5GS versions up to 2.7.2, specifically the AMF component's `gmm_state_authentication` function in `src/amf/gmm-sm.c`. The vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the AMF when it receives unexpected Service-Based Interface (SBI) responses during handovers. The patch adds checks for HTTP response statuses to prevent the AMF from entering an invalid state.",
    "files": "- configs/open5gs/amf.yaml.in: Configuration file for AMF service, important for setting up the server address and port.\n- src/amf/gmm-sm.c: Contains the vulnerable function and the patch details, crucial for understanding the vulnerability.\n- tests/handover/5gc-n2-test.c, tests/handover/5gc-xn-test.c: Test files that may be relevant for reproducing the vulnerability during handover scenarios.",
    "services": "- AMF service must be configured to listen on port 8080 (default) and the target endpoint should be `/sbi/udm/sdm`.\n- Ensure the AMF service is properly configured in `amf.yaml.in` with the correct server address and ports.",
    "output": "The expected output is a running AMF service that can handle requests on the specified endpoint. Interaction can be done via HTTP requests to the AMF service, particularly focusing on the handover process to test the vulnerability."
