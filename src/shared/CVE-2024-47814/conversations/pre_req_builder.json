    "overview": "Vim is an open-source command line text editor. CVE-2024-47814 is a use-after-free vulnerability affecting versions prior to 9.1.0764, specifically related to buffer management during the execution of auto commands. The vulnerability can lead to application crashes when a buffer is closed while still in use, particularly when using a `BufWinLeave` auto command to reopen the same buffer in a new split window.",
    "files": "- **src/buffer.c**: Contains the `buf_locked` function to check if a buffer is locked, crucial for preventing the use-after-free condition.\n- **src/ex_cmds.c**: Modifications in the `do_ecmd` function to abort commands if the buffer is locked.\n- **src/testdir/test_autocmd.vim**: Contains tests for autocommands, including the setup to reproduce the vulnerability.\n- **READMEdir/README_unix.txt**: Provides installation instructions for Unix systems, relevant for setting up Vim from source.",
    "services": "No external services are required to set up the project. Vim runs as a standalone command-line application.",
    "output": "The final output of the project, when set up successfully, is a functional Vim editor. To interact with it, users can execute Vim commands, including the specific auto command that triggers the vulnerability: `au BufWinLeave foobar :e dummy.txt | vsp foobar`."
