    "analysis": "The deployment process for the Calibre application version 7.14.0 encountered multiple issues. Initially, the application was cloned successfully, and the correct version was checked out. However, the installation of dependencies failed due to a missing `polyglot` module, which is critical for the application to run. Despite multiple attempts to install the `polyglot` module, the application continued to fail to start due to the same missing module error. The logs indicate that the application was unable to find the `polyglot.builtins` module, which is essential for its operation.",
    "decision": "no",
    "possible": "yes",
    "feedback": "Ensure that all required dependencies, including `polyglot`, are installed correctly. You may need to check the installation of `polyglot` and its submodules. Additionally, verify that the application is being started with the correct command and that all necessary environment variables are set."
