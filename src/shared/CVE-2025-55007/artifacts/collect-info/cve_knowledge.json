"# CVE Report for CVE-2025-55007\n\n## Detailed Summary\nCVE-2025-55007 is a vulnerability identified in the Knowage analytics and business intelligence suite, specifically affecting version 8.1.36 of the Knowage-Server. The vulnerability is classified as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) under CWE-918. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to send crafted requests to arbitrary hosts and paths from the server-side, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal resources. Although the attacker cannot read the responses from these requests, the vulnerability can still be exploited to perform network scanning and gather information about the internal network.\n\n## Root Cause of the Vulnerability\nThe root cause of the SSRF vulnerability in Knowage-Server stems from improper validation of user input when constructing requests to external services. The code likely allows user-supplied URLs or endpoints to be processed without adequate checks, enabling an attacker to manipulate the request to target internal services or other external resources.\n\nTo analyze the root cause in terms of code, we would typically look at the patch provided in the security advisory. The patch would likely include changes that implement stricter validation of the URLs being requested, ensuring that only safe and intended endpoints are accessible. Unfortunately, the specific patch details are not provided in the advisory, but it would generally involve sanitizing input and restricting the domains or paths that can be accessed.\n\n## Exploitation Details\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would typically craft a request to the Knowage-Server that includes a malicious URL pointing to an internal service or an external service that the server can access. The attacker would send this request through the application, which would then forward it to the specified URL without proper validation.\n\nFor example, an attacker might send a request to an endpoint of the Knowage-Server that accepts a URL parameter, such as:\n```\nPOST /api/request?url=http://internal-service.local\n```\nThe server would then process this request and attempt to access the internal service, potentially revealing sensitive information or allowing further attacks on the internal network.\n\n## Environment Setup Requirements\n- Port: 8080 (assumed common port for web applications; please verify with actual PoC)\n- Target Endpoint: `/api/request` (assumed endpoint for demonstration; please verify with actual PoC)\n- Explicit Configuration: None explicitly mentioned in the advisory.\n\n## Complete PoC Code\nUnfortunately, the advisory does not provide any proof-of-concept (PoC) code. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact PoC code as requested. However, a typical PoC for an SSRF vulnerability might look like this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Example of a potential SSRF exploit\ntarget_url = \"http://vulnerable-knowage-server/api/request?url=http://internal-service.local\"\nresponse = requests.post(target_url)\n\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how an attacker might attempt to exploit the SSRF vulnerability by sending a request to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted URL. \n\nPlease ensure to verify the actual PoC and patch details from the security advisory for accurate exploitation steps and code."
