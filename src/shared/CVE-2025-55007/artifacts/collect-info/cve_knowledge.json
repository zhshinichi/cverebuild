"# CVE Report for CVE-2025-55007\n\n## Detailed Summary\nCVE-2025-55007 is a vulnerability identified in the Knowage analytics and business intelligence suite, specifically affecting version 8.1.36 and earlier. The vulnerability is classified as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) under CWE-918. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to send crafted requests to arbitrary hosts and paths from the server-side, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal resources. Although the attacker cannot read the responses from these requests, the ability to send requests can be leveraged to perform network scanning and other reconnaissance activities within the internal network.\n\n## Root Cause of the Vulnerability\nThe root cause of the SSRF vulnerability in Knowage is likely due to insufficient validation and sanitization of user input that is used to construct outgoing requests. The code responsible for handling requests may allow user-supplied URLs or endpoints to be processed without proper checks, enabling an attacker to manipulate the request to target internal services or resources.\n\nTo analyze the root cause further, we would typically examine the patch provided in the security advisory. However, since the patch details are not included in the provided information, we can infer that the patch likely includes additional validation checks to ensure that any URLs or endpoints specified by users are restricted to safe and intended targets, preventing arbitrary requests to external or internal systems.\n\n## Exploitation Details\nWhile the security advisory does not provide explicit steps to exploit the vulnerability, we can outline a general approach based on the nature of SSRF vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: An attacker would need access to the Knowage application running on version 8.1.36.\n2. **Craft a Malicious Request**: The attacker would send a request to the Knowage server, including a URL that points to an internal service or resource that should not be accessible externally.\n3. **Send the Request**: The attacker would use the application’s functionality that processes user input to send the crafted request.\n4. **Network Scanning**: By iterating through various internal IP addresses and ports, the attacker could potentially discover services running on the internal network.\n\n## Environment Setup Requirements\n- Port: Not explicitly mentioned in the advisory, but typically, web applications like Knowage run on standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (80/443) unless configured otherwise.\n- Target Endpoint: Not specified in the advisory; however, the attacker would likely target an endpoint that accepts user input for URLs.\n- Explicit Configuration: No specific flags or environment variables are mentioned in the advisory.\n\n## Complete PoC Code\nThe advisory does not provide any proof-of-concept (PoC) code. Therefore, there is no exact PoC code to include in this report. \n\nIn summary, CVE-2025-55007 represents a significant security risk due to its potential for internal network scanning via SSRF, and it is crucial for users of Knowage to upgrade to version 8.1.37 or later to mitigate this vulnerability."
