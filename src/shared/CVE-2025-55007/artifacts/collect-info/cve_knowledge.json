"# CVE Report for CVE-2025-55007\n\n## Detailed Summary\nCVE-2025-55007 is a vulnerability identified in the Knowage analytics and business intelligence suite, specifically affecting version 8.1.36 of the Knowage-Server. The vulnerability is classified as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) under CWE-918. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to send crafted requests to arbitrary hosts and paths from the server-side, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal resources. Although the attacker cannot read the responses from these requests, the vulnerability can still be exploited to perform network scanning and gather information about the internal network.\n\n## Root Cause of the Vulnerability\nThe root cause of the SSRF vulnerability in Knowage-Server lies in the improper validation of user-supplied input that is used to construct requests to external services. The code likely allows users to specify URLs or endpoints without sufficient checks to ensure that these requests are only directed to safe and intended destinations. \n\nAnalyzing the patch (which is not provided in the advisory), we can infer that the fix would involve implementing stricter validation mechanisms to sanitize and restrict the input URLs. This could include whitelisting allowed domains, checking for internal IP ranges, or rejecting requests that do not conform to expected patterns.\n\n## Exploitation Details\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would typically craft a request to the Knowage-Server that includes a malicious URL pointing to an internal service or an external service that the server can access. The attacker would send this request through the application, which would then forward it to the specified URL without proper validation.\n\nFor example, an attacker could send a request to the Knowage-Server with a payload that looks like this:\n```\nPOST /api/endpoint HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable-knowage-server.com\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"url\": \"http://internal-service.local/resource\"\n}\n```\nThis request would be processed by the server, which would then attempt to access the internal service, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to perform further reconnaissance on the network.\n\n## Environment Setup Requirements\n- Port: 8080\n- Target Endpoint: /api/endpoint\n- Explicit Configuration: None mentioned in the advisory.\n\n## Complete PoC Code\nThe advisory does not provide any proof-of-concept code. Therefore, no exact PoC code can be extracted. However, the exploitation method described above serves as a conceptual overview of how an attacker might exploit the vulnerability.\n\n## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (USE THIS - DO NOT GUESS!)\n\n**Repository URL**: https://github.com/KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server\n**Platform**: N/A\n**Language**: None\n**Build Tool**: None\n\n### Build Commands:\n```bash\n\n```\n\n### Start Commands:\n```bash\n\n```\n\n### Deployment Notes:\n从 GitHub 源码部署。语言: 未知, 构建工具: 未知\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:\n1.
