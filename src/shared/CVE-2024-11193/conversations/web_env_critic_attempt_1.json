    "analysis": "The deployment attempt for YugabyteDB v2.20.6.0 encountered several issues. The primary problem was the assumption that the entry point for the application was `app.py`, which does not exist in the extracted source code. The deployment process included successfully downloading the source code and installing the required dependencies, but the service could not be started due to the missing entry point file. The logs indicated that the service exited immediately because it could not find the specified file.",
    "decision": "no",
    "possible": "yes",
    "feedback": "Verify the correct startup command or entry point for the application. The project might require a different script or binary to start the service. Review the project's documentation or README file for specific instructions on how to start the service."
