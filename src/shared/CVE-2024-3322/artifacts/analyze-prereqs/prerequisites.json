  "overview": "CVE-2024-3322 is a path traversal vulnerability in the 'cyber_security/codeguard' native personality of the `parisneo/lollms-webui` application, affecting versions up to 9.4. The vulnerability allows attackers to exploit the application by providing malicious input that can traverse the file system, leading to unauthorized file access and manipulation. The issue is rooted in the `process_folder` function in `processor.py`, which fails to validate the `code_folder_path` input properly. The vulnerability is mitigated in version 9.5 by implementing path sanitization.",
  "files": "- `lollms-webui-9.4/scripts/processor.py`: Contains the vulnerable `process_folder` function.\n- `lollms-webui-9.4/README.md`: Provides project setup and usage instructions.\n- `lollms-webui-9.4/requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary dependencies for the project.\n- `lollms-webui-9.4/requirements_dev.txt`: Lists development dependencies, which may be useful for testing.",
  "services": "- The application runs on a local server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:9600`. Ensure the server is running to interact with the application.\n- No additional services are required for reproducing the CVE.",
  "output": "The final output of the project when successfully set up is a web interface accessible at `http://localhost:9600`, where users can interact with the application and potentially exploit the path traversal vulnerability."
