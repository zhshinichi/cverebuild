{
    "overview": "The project is an ASP.NET Core library named `ICG.AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage`, designed to facilitate file storage in cloud environments, specifically Azure. The vulnerability CVE-2024-50353 affects version 6.0.0 of this library, where the expiration time for Shared Access Signature (SAS) URIs is hardcoded to 1 hour, leading to improper access control. The project includes a main library and a set of tests to validate its functionality.",
    "files": "- `src/AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage/AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage.csproj`: Project file containing metadata and dependencies for the library.\n- `src/AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage/AzureCloudStorageProvider.cs`: Contains the implementation of the cloud storage provider, crucial for understanding how SAS URIs are generated.\n- `src/AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage/BlobUriInfo.cs`: Defines the structure for blob URI information, relevant for SAS URI generation.\n- `src/AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage.Tests/AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage.Tests.csproj`: Project file for the test suite, necessary for running tests against the library.\n- `src/AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage.Tests/AzureCloudStorageProviderTests.cs`: Contains unit tests for the cloud storage provider, useful for validating the vulnerability and its fix.",
    "services": "- No external services are explicitly required to run the project. However, Azure Storage services must be configured for testing the library's functionality.",
    "output": "The final output of the project is a library that can generate SAS URIs for Azure Blob Storage. Users can interact with it by creating instances of the `AzureCloudStorageProvider` and calling methods to generate SAS URIs, ensuring that the expiration time reflects the user-defined duration."
