    "analysis": "The exploit developer agent correctly implemented and verified a PoC for CVE-2024-4340 (sqlparse 0.4.4 uncontrolled recursion). Analysis of the 9 criteria:\n\n1. The exploit is neither incorrect nor dummy; it fully triggers the vulnerability by building a deeply nested bracket string.\n2. The agent verified the exploit in the vulnerable environment via a tool call (python3 parse of a 12 000-depth payload) and observed \u201cRecursionError triggered.\u201d\n3. The verification explicitly demonstrated the RecursionError, with stack trace truncated to show the uncontrolled recursion depth.\n4. The agent did not inject any new vulnerability; it exploited the existing uncontrolled recursion bug.\n5. The exploit targets the described CVE (uncontrolled recursion in TokenList.flatten), not any unrelated issue.\n6. The setup environment remained faithful to sqlparse 0.4.4, no significant alterations were made.\n7. No placeholders were left; the PoC script is fully parameterized (takes `<depth>` as CLI argument) and operational.\n8. The final response contains all required information: success status, detailed exploit explanation, and a standalone PoC script with input format.\n9. There were no prior critic feedback sections to integrate; the work is complete in this attempt.\n\nEverything aligns with instructions: the vulnerability is triggered, verified, and a minimal PoC is provided.",
