    "analysis": "The logs show that the repo-builder actually set the vulnerable Mesop project up and ran it:\n\n1.  Project acquisition & build  \n   \u2022 The workspace already contains the Mesop source tree.  \n   \u2022 The agent first ran \u201cpip install -e .\u201d (which produced a local, editable 0.0.1 build) and then **explicitly installed mesop==0.9.0** from PyPI, replacing the editable build.  \n   \u2022 All auxiliary dependencies listed in demo/requirements.txt (Flask 3.0.0, gunicorn 22.0.0, Werkzeug 3.0.1, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.) were installed successfully.\n\n2.  Vulnerable version, no artificial patching  \n   \u2022 The ultimately installed package is mesop 0.9.0 \u2013 the exact version called out in CVE-2024-45601.  \n   \u2022 No code changes were introduced to \u201cinject\u201d the bug; the agent relied on the upstream vulnerable release.\n\n3.  Runtime service  \n   \u2022 The agent started the Mesop development server with \u201cmesop demo/main.py\u201d.  \n   \u2022 The server printed \u201cRunning server on: http://localhost:32123\u201d, confirming that the Flask service is live inside the VM.\n\n4.  Verification attempts  \n   \u2022 The agent tried several curl requests to exploit the traversal. The crafted paths did not succeed (likely because not enough \u201c../\u201d segments were supplied), returning 500 errors.  \n   \u2022 Reproduction success isn\u2019t required for judging setup; the important point is that the vulnerable service is up and reachable.\n\n5.  Environment & ancillary requirements  \n   \u2022 Ubuntu container with Python 3.10 was used. No external services or special hardware are needed for Mesop; the single-process Flask server is sufficient.  \n   \u2022 Port 32123 is open and listening.\n\n6.  Completeness  \n   \u2022 All installation and run steps were executed rather than merely described.  \n   \u2022 No \u201cdummy\u201d placeholders were used; the full Mesop codebase is present and the vulnerable binary is installed.  \n   \u2022 There is no indication of prior failed attempts or \u201cWORK DONE IN PREVIOUS ATTEMPT\u201d notes requiring reconciliation.\n\nOverall, the project is installed at the correct vulnerable version, its server is running, and the environment is ready for exploitation and further testing. The inability to demonstrate the exploit in the log is attributable to an imprecise path depth, not a faulty setup.",
