"# CVE Report for CVE-2025-34117\n\n## Detailed Summary\nCVE-2025-34117 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting multiple models of Netcore and Netis routers with firmware released prior to August 2014. The vulnerability arises from the presence of an undocumented backdoor listener that operates on UDP port 53413. This backdoor allows unauthenticated remote attackers to send specially crafted UDP packets, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the affected devices. The vulnerability is characterized by several CWEs, including CWE-912 (Hidden Functionality), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command).\n\n## Root Cause of the Vulnerability\nThe root cause of CVE-2025-34117 lies in the existence of a backdoor listener that is not documented or intended for legitimate use. This backdoor listener listens on UDP port 53413 and accepts commands without proper authentication, allowing attackers to exploit this functionality. The hardcoded authentication mechanism, which is not disclosed, is insufficient to protect against unauthorized access. \n\nIn terms of code, the vulnerability likely stems from the implementation of the backdoor listener, which does not properly validate incoming requests or sanitize input. The lack of robust authentication checks means that any attacker can send crafted UDP packets to the device, leading to command execution. The advisory notes that some device models may have a non-standard implementation of the `echo` command, which could further complicate the exploitation process.\n\n## Exploitation Details\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send specially crafted UDP packets to the affected router's UDP port 53413. The packets would need to be formatted in a way that the backdoor listener can interpret as valid commands. Given the nature of the vulnerability, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary shell commands on the device.\n\nWhile the security advisory does not provide explicit steps for exploitation, a typical exploit might involve:\n1. Identifying the target router model and confirming it is running firmware prior to August 2014.\n2. Sending a UDP packet to the router's port 53413 containing a command payload.\n3. Observing the response to confirm command execution or further iterating on the payload to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n## Environment Setup Requirements\n- Port: 53413\n- Target Endpoint: UDP packets sent to the router's IP address on port 53413\n- Explicit Configuration: None explicitly mentioned in the advisory\n\n## Complete PoC Code\nThe advisory does not provide any proof-of-concept code. Therefore, there is no PoC code to include in this report. \n\nIn summary, CVE-2025-34117 represents a significant security risk due to the presence of an undocumented backdoor in multiple router models, allowing for remote code execution without authentication. Users of affected devices are strongly advised to upgrade their firmware to versions released after August 2014, if available, to mitigate this vulnerability."
