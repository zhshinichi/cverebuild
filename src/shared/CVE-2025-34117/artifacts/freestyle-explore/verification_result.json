This could be due to the lack of proper emulation of the undocumented backdoor listener on UDP port 53413, or network restrictions within the Docker environment that prevent the correct handling of UDP packets.\n建议: Re-evaluate the test environment to ensure it accurately represents the vulnerable router models. Consider using a physical device with the known vulnerable firmware or a more sophisticated emulation setup that can handle UDP traffic and backdoor functionality. Verify that the backdoor listener is active and correctly configured to accept and process the crafted UDP packets.",
