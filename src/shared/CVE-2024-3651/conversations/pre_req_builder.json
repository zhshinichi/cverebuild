{
    "overview": "CVE-2024-3651 affects the `kjd/idna` library, specifically the `idna.encode()` function, which has a vulnerability leading to denial of service due to quadratic complexity in processing specially crafted input strings. The vulnerable version is 3.6. The project contains the implementation of the `idna` library and tests that can be used to reproduce the vulnerability.",
    "files": "- `idna/__init__.py`: Initializes the `idna` package and imports necessary functions, including `encode()`, which is the vulnerable function.\n- `tests/test_vulnerability.py`: Contains the proof-of-concept code that demonstrates the vulnerability by invoking `idna.encode()` with crafted input.\n- `tests/test_idna.py`: Includes unit tests for the `idna` library, which may help in understanding the library's functionality and testing the vulnerability.",
    "services": "No external services are required to set up the project. The PoC can be executed locally without any specific configuration.",
    "output": "The final output of the project when set up successfully is the ability to run the PoC code in `tests/test_vulnerability.py`, which will demonstrate the denial of service condition when executing `idna.encode()` with the crafted input."
