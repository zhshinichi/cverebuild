# CVE Report for CVE-2024-3935

## Summary
CVE-2024-3935 is a double free vulnerability identified in the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker, specifically affecting versions from 2.0.0 through 2.0.18. The vulnerability arises when a Mosquitto broker is configured to create an outgoing bridge connection with an incoming topic that utilizes topic remapping. If a remote connection sends a specially crafted PUBLISH packet to the broker, it triggers a double free condition, leading to a crash of the broker.

### Vulnerability Type
- **CWE-415**: Double Free

### Affected Version
- **Eclipse Mosquitto**: v2.0.18

## Root Cause of the Vulnerability
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the handling of incoming messages on a bridge connection. When the Mosquitto broker is set up to bridge messages from a remote MQTT broker, it may receive messages on topics that include wildcards. The code responsible for remapping these topics does not adequately validate the incoming messages, leading to a situation where the same memory is freed multiple times (double free). 

The provided patch indicates that the issue was addressed by ensuring that after freeing the memory associated with a topic, the pointer is set to NULL. This prevents further attempts to free the same memory again, which is the core of the double free vulnerability.

### Code Analysis
The patch modifies the `bridge__remap_topic_in` function in `src/bridge_topic.c`. The changes include:
- Setting the topic pointer to NULL after freeing it, which prevents subsequent operations from attempting to free the same pointer again.

```c
if(rc){
    mosquitto__free(*topic);
    *topic = NULL; // Prevent double free
    return rc;
}
```

This change is crucial as it ensures that once the memory is freed, the pointer does not point to a deallocated memory location, thus mitigating the risk of double free.

## Exploitation Details
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:
1. Set up a Mosquitto broker configured with an outgoing bridge connection.
2. Configure the broker to accept incoming messages on topics that utilize wildcard remapping.
3. Send a crafted PUBLISH packet to the broker that triggers the double free condition.

The advisory provides a configuration file (`test_br.conf`) and a Python script (`server.py`) to facilitate the reproduction of the vulnerability.

## Environment Setup Requirements
- **Port**: 1883 (for the Mosquitto broker)
- **Target Endpoint**: The broker listens on `tcp://127.0.0.1:1883`
- **Explicit Configuration**: The configuration file `test_br.conf` should include the following settings:
  ```
  listener 1883
  allow_anonymous true
  connection bridge1
  address 127.0.0.1:1884
  keepalive_interval 60
  topic room1/# both 2 sensor/ myhouse/
  topic tst/ba both 2
  topic # both 2
  keepalive_interval 600
  remote_clientid mosquitto
  bridge_protocol_version mqttv50
  notifications false
  ```

## Complete PoC Code
The following is the complete proof-of-concept code provided in the advisory:

### `server.py`
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Does a bridge resend a QoS=1 message correctly after a disconnect?
