    "overview": "CVE-2024-6984 affects Juju versions v3.5.2 and earlier, allowing unprivileged users to leak sensitive context IDs due to overly permissive file permissions on the /var/lib/juju/ directory. The vulnerability is exacerbated by logging sensitive information in error messages. A patch has been provided to prevent context ID exposure in error messages.",
    "files": "- **README.md**: Contains project setup instructions and dependencies.\n- **/var/lib/juju/tools/unit-opensearch-4/secret-ids**: This tool is crucial for reproducing the CVE as it interacts with the Juju agent socket.\n- **/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-opensearch-4/agent.socket**: The socket file that the PoC script interacts with.\n- **PoC Script**: The provided proof-of-concept script demonstrates the exploitation process and is essential for testing the vulnerability.",
    "services": "- **Juju Agent**: Must be running and configured to use the Unix socket located at `/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-opensearch-4/agent.socket`.\n- **Environment Variables**: Set the following before running the PoC script:\n  - `JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET_NETWORK=unix`\n  - `JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET_ADDRESS=@/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-opensearch-4/agent.socket`\n  - `JUJU_CONTEXT_ID=<context_id>` (this will be dynamically captured by the script)",
    "output": "The final output of the project setup will be the ability to run the PoC script successfully, which will continuously attempt to retrieve context IDs and access sensitive data, demonstrating the vulnerability's impact."
