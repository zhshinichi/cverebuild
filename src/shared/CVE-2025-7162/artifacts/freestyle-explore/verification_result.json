The specific version of the Zoo Management System could not be downloaded from the provided GitHub URL, resulting in a 404 error. Additionally, an alternative download attempt from PHPGurukul resulted in an invalid zip archive, preventing successful extraction and setup. Furthermore, the PHP and Apache service setup in a Docker container was not accessible, indicating potential misconfiguration or network issues.\n建议: Verify the availability and integrity of the software package required for the environment setup. Ensure that the Docker container is correctly configured and accessible. Once the environment is correctly set up, reattempt the exploitation to confirm the presence of the vulnerability.",
