  "output": "The attempt to download and set up the vulnerable environment for CVE-2025-7162 has encountered several issues:\n\n1. **Download Failure**: The initial attempt to download the specific version of the Zoo Management System from GitHub resulted in a 404 error, indicating that the resource is not available at the specified URL.\n\n2. **Alternative Download**: Attempts to download from an alternative source (PHPGurukul) were made, but the downloaded file was not a valid zip archive, leading to an extraction failure.\n\n3. **Service Setup**: The PHP and Apache service was set up in a Docker container, but the service was not accessible on the expected port, indicating a potential misconfiguration or issue with the container setup.\n\nGiven these issues, the environment setup for reproducing the vulnerability was not successful. Without a proper environment, executing the PoC for the SQL injection vulnerability is not feasible.\n\nI recommend verifying the availability of the required software package and ensuring the Docker container is correctly configured to serve the application. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verification_result\": {\n    \"env_ready\": false,\n    \"poc_executed\": false,\n    \"passed\": false,\n    \"evidence\": \"Failed to set up the vulnerable environment due to download and configuration issues.\",\n    \"error_message\": \"Resource not found and invalid archive format.\"\n  }\n}\n```",
