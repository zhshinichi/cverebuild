    "overview": "MicroPython is a lean implementation of Python 3 designed for microcontrollers and constrained environments. The CVE-2024-8948 vulnerability is a critical heap-based buffer overflow in the `mpz_as_bytes` function, which occurs when converting an integer to bytes with a length of zero. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely, allowing attackers to manipulate the conversion process.",
    "files": "- `py/objint.c`: Contains the vulnerable `mpz_as_bytes` function. This file is crucial for understanding the vulnerability and testing the exploit.\n- `tests`: This directory contains various test cases, including those that may demonstrate the vulnerability. The tests can be used to verify the presence of the CVE.\n- `README` or similar documentation files (if present) should be checked for additional setup instructions, but none were explicitly listed in the directory tree.",
    "services": "- A local web server should be set up to listen on port 8080, as this is the assumed port for demonstration purposes. The target endpoint for testing the vulnerability is `/int.to_bytes`.\n- No additional services are explicitly required for reproducing the CVE.",
    "output": "The final output of the project, when set up successfully, should allow interaction via HTTP requests to the `/int.to_bytes` endpoint. The expected behavior is that invoking `(0).to_bytes(0, \"big\")` should raise an `OverflowError`, demonstrating the vulnerability."
