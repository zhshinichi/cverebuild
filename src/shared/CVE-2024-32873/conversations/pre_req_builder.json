    "overview": "CVE-2024-32873 affects the Evmos blockchain platform, specifically in the handling of clawback vesting accounts. The vulnerability allows unauthorized transfers of funds due to incorrect calculations of spendable balances when delegating vested tokens. The issue is present in version v17.0.1 and has been patched in version v18.0.0. The vulnerability is rooted in the `TrackDelegation` function, which failed to properly distinguish between vested and unvested tokens.",
    "files": "- `app/upgrades/v17`: Contains the vulnerable version of the code.\n- `app/upgrades/v18`: Contains the patched version of the code.\n- `proto/evmos/vesting/v1`: Contains the protocol buffer definitions related to vesting accounts.\n- `cmd/evmosd`: The main command to run the Evmos application.\n- `scripts`: May contain scripts for setting up or testing the environment.",
    "services": "- **Evmos Node**: Must be run on port 8080.\n  - Configuration: Ensure the vesting account is created with the clawback feature enabled.\n  - Target Endpoint: `/evmos/v1/vesting`.",
    "output": "The final output of the project will be an operational Evmos blockchain node that can create clawback vesting accounts and allow interaction with the vesting functionality. Users can test the vulnerability by attempting to delegate unvested tokens and monitor the spendable balance."
