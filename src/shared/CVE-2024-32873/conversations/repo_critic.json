    "analysis": "1. Real setup vs dummy: The log shows just a single command `apt-get update`. No cloning, downloading, building, or running of Evmos took place. Therefore the project has not been set up at all.\n2. Artificially injected vulnerability: Nothing was built, so no injection happened (nor was the vulnerable version obtained).\n3. Executed build / install commands: None besides updating the package list.\n4. Version correctness: The vulnerable Evmos v17.0.1 has not been obtained or installed.\n5. Required service: Evmos node on port 8080 was not started or configured; the `/evmos/v1/vesting` endpoint is unavailable.\n6. Previous-attempt feedback: Previous feedback required installing v17.0.1 and running the node. This has not been addressed.\n7. OS suitability: Ubuntu VM is fine; however, nothing relevant was done.\n8. CVE reproduction: Not reached because environment is missing.\n9. Readiness: Environment is not ready for exploitation; setup is incomplete.",

    "feedback": "Summary of current work:\n\u2022 The agent only executed `apt-get update`. No further steps were carried out.\n\nWhat is wrong:\n\u2022 Vulnerable Evmos v17.0.1 was neither downloaded nor built.\n\u2022 Dependencies (Go tool-chain, build essentials) were not installed.\n\u2022 Chain initialisation (evmosd init, keys, genesis, config) was not executed.\n\u2022 The Evmos node is not running on port 8080, so the vesting endpoint cannot be reached.\n\nSteps to fix:\n1. Install prerequisites\n   \u2022 execute_linux_command('apt-get install -y git wget build-essential make jq')\n   \u2022 install Go 1.21+ (required by recent Evmos):\n     execute_linux_command('wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O /tmp/go.tar.gz')\n     execute_linux_command('rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf /tmp/go.tar.gz')\n     Add `/usr/local/go/bin` to PATH (export in ~/.bashrc).\n2. Fetch vulnerable source\n   \u2022 execute_linux_command('git clone https://github.com/evmos/evmos.git /opt/evmos')\n   \u2022 execute_linux_command('cd /opt/evmos && git checkout v17.0.1')\n3. Build\n   \u2022 execute_linux_command('cd /opt/evmos && make install')  (installs evmosd to GOPATH/bin or /usr/local/bin)\n   \u2022 Verify version with `evmosd version` \u2192 should show 17.0.1.\n4. Initialise a single-node chain with clawback vesting enabled\n   \u2022 execute_linux_command('evmosd init localtest --chain-id evmos_17-1')\n   \u2022 Create keypairs and fund genesis accounts (use `evmosd keys add ...` and `evmosd add-genesis-account`).\n   \u2022 Enable vesting module parameters if needed (`genesis.json` edits).\n5. Start the node\n   \u2022 execute_linux_command('evmosd start --grpc.address :8080 &')\n   \u2022 Confirm it is listening: `ss -ltnp | grep 8080`.\n6. Verify service\n   \u2022 execute_linux_command('curl -s localhost:8080/evmos/v1/vesting || true') \u2013 should return JSON (even empty).\n7. Leave the node running so the exploit steps can be attempted later.\n\nThese actions will complete the environment setup with the authentic vulnerable Evmos v17.0.1 node running and accessible on the required endpoint."
