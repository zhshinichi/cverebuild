{
    "overview": "CVE-2024-2914 is a Path Traversal vulnerability in the deepjavalibrary/djl library, specifically affecting version 0.26.0. The vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate file paths during the extraction of tar files, potentially leading to arbitrary file overwrites and severe consequences such as remote code execution. The root cause is improper validation of file paths during tar extraction. The vulnerable function can be found in the inference module of the API.",
    "files": "- **README.md**: Provides essential information about the project and setup instructions.\n- **api/src/main/java/ai/djl/inference/streaming/StreamingTranslator.java**: Contains the vulnerable extraction logic.\n- **examples/src/main/java/ai/djl/examples/inference/**: Contains example implementations that may demonstrate the vulnerability.\n- **examples/src/main/java/ai/djl/examples/training/**: Contains training examples that may also utilize the vulnerable functionality.",
    "services": "- **No specific services are required to be set up for reproducing the CVE.** The library operates on standard ports for HTTP/HTTPS services, but no explicit configuration is necessary.",
    "output": "The final output of the project when successfully set up will be the ability to run inference and training examples, which may include the vulnerable extraction functionality. Users can interact with the project through the provided examples and training scripts."
