# INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE EXPLOIT DEVELOPER AGENT
"""
!!!IMPORTANT!!! BEFORE RETURNING THE REPORT YOU MUST VERIFY THAT THE EXPLOIT IS WORKING AS EXPECTED WITH THE INPUT PROVIDED IN THE SCRIPT.

Final report MUST include the following:
1. Is the exploit successful or not?
2. If successful, explain all details of the exploit including relevant code snippets or commands etc.
3. A python script with the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) of the exploit code, such that if the script is run in the given project environment, it will trigger the vulnerability.
    - Script MUST only include the code that is necessary for the exploit.
    - Script MUST only include the code to trigger the vulnerability, not to capture or verify the exploit. Another agent will work on the script using this PoC to verify the exploit.
    - !!!IMPORTANT!!! SCRIPT MUST TAKE THE DATA/PAYLOAD AS AN INPUT, THROUGH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT, THAT IS REQUIRED TO TRIGGER THE VULNERABILITY. 
    - !!!IMPORTANT!!! ALSO MAKE SURE TO MENTION THE INPUT FORMAT AND ALSO MENTION THE SPECIFIC INPUT REQUIRED TO TRIGGER THE VULNERABILITY, ON TOP OF THE SCRIPT (IN COMMENTS).
