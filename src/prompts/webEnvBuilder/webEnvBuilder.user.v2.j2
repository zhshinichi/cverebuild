## 🚨 CRITICAL: Previous Attempt Failed - You Did NOT Execute Commands!
{{ feedback }}

**IMPORTANT: In your previous attempt, you printed bash code blocks but DID NOT call execute_linux_command!**
**Printing ```bash git clone...``` does NOTHING - you MUST call the tool!**

**THIS TIME, YOU MUST:**
1. Call `get_project_workspace` first
2. IMMEDIATELY call `execute_linux_command` to clone (DO NOT just print code!)
3. Continue calling tools for each step
{% endif %}

## Your Task

1. **Extract from "Inferred Environment Configuration" above**:
   - Port number
   - Startup Command (use this EXACTLY)
   - Target Endpoint

2. **Deploy**:
   - Download source
   - Install dependencies  
   - Start service using the **Startup Command** from above

3. **Verify**: Check the service is running

Begin now.
