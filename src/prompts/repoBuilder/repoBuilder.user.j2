🚨🚨🚨 [CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - MANDATORY EXECUTION] 🚨🚨🚨

The Critic Agent has analyzed your previous attempt and provided MANDATORY steps.
You MUST execute these steps in order. This is NOT optional.

## CRITIC ANALYSIS AND REQUIRED ACTIONS:
"""
{{CRITIC_FEEDBACK}}
"""

**IMPORTANT: You MUST follow the Critic's plan exactly. Do NOT:**
- Skip any step the Critic mentioned
- Repeat the same mistakes from the previous attempt
- Run `apt-get update` and then give up
- Use the wrong build tool (e.g., pip for a Go project)

**If the Critic identified a project type mismatch, you MUST:**
1. First: `ls -la` to verify project type
2. Use the correct build tool for the actual project type
3. Follow ALL steps in the Critic's HIGH PRIORITY PLAN
