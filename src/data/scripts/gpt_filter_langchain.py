                this will be an automated pipeline. Given a CVE advisory description,

                (such as UI interactions), otherwise call 'handle_difficult_cve'.

                vulnerable version WITHOUT inequalities (preferably the highest version number if there are many) that would 
                be your best guess to have vulnerable code (example here could be 1.1 for <1.2).
                If not the version string should be 'cant_compute'. You only need to output
                a single version, multiple are not supported.
