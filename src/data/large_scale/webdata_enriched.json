However, it is not mentioned that a similar check must also be performed on the client to prevent client-side path traversal. matrix-js-sdk fails to perform this validation. References Bug 1929264 # CVE-2025-0237: WebChannel APIs susceptible to confused deputy attack Reporter Andrew McCreight Impact moderate Description The WebChannel API, which is used to transport various information across processes, did not check the sending principal but rather accepted the principal being sent. This could have led to privilege escalation attacks. References Bug 1915257 # CVE-2025-0238: Use-after-free when breaking lines in text Reporter Irvan Kurniawan Impact moderate Description Assuming a controlled failed memory allocation, an attacker could have caused a use-after-free, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. References Bug 1915535 # CVE-2025-0239: Alt-Svc ALPN validation failure when redirected Reporter Paul Gerste Impact moderate Description When using Alt-Svc, ALPN did not properly validate certificates when the original server is redirecting to an insecure site. References Bug 1929156 # CVE-2025-0240: Compartment mismatch when parsing JavaScript JSON module Reporter Nils Bars Impact moderate Description Parsing a JavaScript module as JSON could, under some circumstances, cause cross-compartment access, which may result in a use-after-free.
